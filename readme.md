Contour-based 3D Fault Meshing utilities.

`ccfm` provides helper functions to build 3D fault meshes from contour data (e.g. top, middle, and bottom LineStrings).  
It is developed as part of the [Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center (CRESCENT)](https://cascadiaquakes.org) tools.

## Features

- Read/write simple contour geometries
- Geometry helpers (constants, basic operations)
- Mesh construction utilities
- Designed to be used in QGIS plugins and standalone scripts
